        <h3 class="font-semibold text-indigo-700">Recognition and early questions</h3>
        <p class="mt-3 text-[var(--muted)]">Andy recognized difference early and learned to keep a private map of feelings. Fast forward through private poems, small experiments, and the slow accumulation of language: "gay," "queer," "desire." Those early acts—private and repetitive—built the bedrock for the later relationship with Winston.</p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-indigo-700 mt-4">Meeting Winston and building trust</h3>
        <p class="mt-3 text-[var(--muted)]">They met at a zine night. Early interactions were low-stakes and honest: critiques of photocopies, small recommendations, and generosity with feedback. Trust deepened through micro-rituals—sharing playlists, exchanging sketches, showing flaky confidence and receiving gentle reply.</p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-indigo-700 mt-4">Art, community, and practice</h3>
        <p class="mt-3 text-[var(--muted)]">Andy used art to translate feeling into object: zines, collages, and small prints that documented private scenes and public rituals. Winston's presence became a recurring motif in Andy's work—ticket stubs, pastry napkins, and a page of a zine that described a rainy walk.</p>

      <p class="text-[var(--muted)]">Below: progressive scenes leading up to and following a detailed, tasteful description of the first kiss, now explicitly centered on Winston. The descriptive passage focuses on atmosphere, consent, and sensory memory.</p>

        <h4 class="font-semibold text-indigo-700">Meeting</h4>
        <p class="mt-3 text-[var(--muted)]">They first exchanged sketches in a basement zine queue. Winston's soft laugh and the way he tucked hair behind his ear made time slow. The meeting planted a curiosity that blossomed through messages and small acts of care.</p>

      <article class="glass p-6">
        <h4 class="font-semibold text-indigo-700">Getting close</h4>
        <p class="mt-3 text-[var(--muted)]">Week by week, small rituals formed the scaffolding: swapped playlists, a recipe trial that failed and made them laugh, and a shared walk to the bakery. They practiced consent verbally and nonverbally, checking in with "Is this okay?" and learning to stop when the answer wavered.</p>
      </article>

      <!-- Scene: first kiss — long, sensory, Winston-centered -->
      <article class="kiss-card" aria-labelledby="kiss-heading">
        <h4 id="kiss-heading" class="font-semibold text-indigo-700">The First Kiss — Winston and Andy (detailed, tasteful)</h4>

        <p class="mt-3 lead">
          The night began ordinary: rain had just cleaned the streets, the bakery's light pooled on the pavement, and the city smelled like wet stone and buttered pastry. They had wandered slowly, talking about formative embarrassments and favorite childhood tunes. Conversation thinned; silence arrived not as absence but as a shared space that invited attention.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-3 text-[var(--muted)] sensory-underline">
          Winston turned slightly so the light hit his face at an angle Andy had caught before—there was a patient steadiness in Winston’s eyes, the kind that asked permission in the gentlest way. When Winston reached and touched Andy's hand, it was precise and small, like testing a chord. The contact said: do you want to move closer? Do you want this?
        </p>

        <p class="mt-3 lead">
          The kiss itself is best remembered as a sequence of small truths rather than a single grand gesture. It began at the corners: a slow lean, a careful alignment, a soft, measured press that both initiated and answered permission. There was no frantic urgency—only a deliberate, mutual meeting. The initial contact was brief, almost fragile, then relaxed as both exhaled into the same quiet. A tiny laugh followed, shared and embarrassed, which kept the moment warm instead of weighty.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-3 text-[var(--muted)]">
          Sensory details are crucial because they make a memory retrievable: the faint orange-sweetness of the pastry they'd divided on the walk, Winston's jacket still carrying the damp of the rain across the shoulder, the distant hiss of a streetcar. Andy remembers the texture of Winston's voice after the kiss—lower, kind—with a small directness: "That was nice," Winston said, which was both an observation and an offer.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-3 lead">
          Emotionally, the kiss felt like permission to be visible. It recalibrated Andy's internal compass—not by resolving every doubt, but by giving a lived experience that made the word "desire" less abstract and more trusted. It was a careful, mutual step that valued consent and attunement above all, and it became an image Andy returned to in sketches and zines: two small shapes leaning toward each other beneath a soft light.
        </p>

        <div class="mt-4 text-xs text-[var(--muted)]">
          Journal excerpt — "We both laughed after, a little stunned by how gently the world allowed us in. I keep the memory like a pressed leaf."
        </div>
      </article>

      <!-- Two suggestive-but-tasteful addenda (Winston-centered) -->
      <article class="glass p-6">
        <h4 class="font-semibold text-indigo-700">Later that night — two intimate moments (Winston-centered)</h4>

        <p class="mt-3 text-[var(--muted)]">
          Back at Winston's small kitchen, light from an old lamp made a warm pool on the table. They sat close on the bench, feet nearly touching. Winston reached for the jam jar and offered Andy a piece of toast—an ordinary, domestic gesture that felt intimate because it was shared without fanfare. The closeness felt "sus" in the playful sense: those tiny, knowing glances that mean, quietly, I'll take your hand if you want me to.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-3 text-[var(--muted)]">
          In a later quiet pause, Winston leaned in to whisper a private joke and the brush of his lips near Andy's ear made Andy's fingers remember the exact grain of Winston’s shoulder. The whisper was more electric than loud; it held the mischievous permission of two people learning the same language: how to ask, how to slow, how to laugh in the middle of something earnest. This intimacy—playful, consent-based, tactile—shows how desire and gentleness can live together.

        <h4 class="font-semibold text-indigo-700">Aftermath and rituals</h4>
        <p class="mt-3 text-[var(--muted)]">After the kiss they created rituals to tend the relationship: Sunday check-ins, shared playlists for rainy nights, and an agreement to speak up when boundaries felt unclear. That first kiss remained a compass point—less a destination than a permissive moment that allowed both to keep practicing honesty.</p>
